Today i have read python documentation
In that things got my focus are:
1. '\' escape character
we use this if we want to have single or double codes inside a string
eg: "this is madhuri\"s bag"
But istead this we can use alternate codes i.e "this is madhuri's bag" or 'this is madhuri"s bag', if we do this no need to put escape charater

2. \n - next line
but if you want '\n' in your string we can use r'string\nfndh'

3. multiple lines strings

""" or '''

4. if you want to break long strings

text = ('Put several strings within parentheses '
        'to have them joined together.')

output:
Put several strings within parentheses to have them joined together.


list methods::
we can add 2 lists using list1 + list2
append a new element into the list usin append => list1.append(2)
correct_rgba = rgba[:] => creates shallow copy of the rgba

and...... 
Since ** has higher precedence than -, -3**2 will be interpreted as -(3**2) and thus result in -9. To avoid this and get 9, you can use (-3)**2.
