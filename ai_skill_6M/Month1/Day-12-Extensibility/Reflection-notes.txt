What parts of your system will change most often?
Data input part in expenseReader class.
if we take file , data collection logic is different ,and it is different when we take input from api.
What parts should almost never change?
core part of analyzer will never change , because we are giving clean data to the analyzer and it is returning required results. Once we colect results its our wish to print in ui or store in a file...etc.
What assumptions would break first if requirements change?
Assuming data comes from file, 
Assuming data format i.e, i assumed data has 1 expense per category , i.e only one record for food, 1 record for travel..etc

Category-wise total spending
OR

Count of expenses per category

to implement this my code breaks,since i am storing data in map , assuming data has 1 expense per category , i.e only one record for food, 1 record for travel..etc., if it has multiple records it will overwrite in map. To implement that i need to store list per each key in map i.e eah cateogry.


If expenses come from an API instead of file:

Which file changes?

Which files remain unchanged?

What new component would you add?

to answer this firstly i dont know how to work with APIs , but i can say that marks_reader file changes, analyzer file does not change, 

Avoid hard-coded file names in main
instead give the file name to a variable and use that variable where ever u want
Pass configuration instead of constants
# main.py
config = {
    "max_amount": 100000
}

reader = ExpenseReader(filename, config)
# expense_reader.py
def __init__(self, filename, config):
    self.filename = filename
    self.max_amount = config["max_amount"]
If a value may change → it is configuration, not logic.
Make analyzer methods independent of internal storage
