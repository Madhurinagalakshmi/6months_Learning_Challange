Refactoring tips:
1. merge nested if statements(using 'and')
2. use 'any' instead of a loop 
for n in numbers:
  if n>0:
    has_pos = True
    break

    instead of this
has_pos = any(n>0)for n in numbers 
3. pull statements out of for/while loops
4. remove inline variables that are used only once
5. replace if statements with if expressions
    instead of if and else u can use something like this
    x = 1 if condition else 2
6. add a gaurd clause
   if there is alot of code there in one condition and in else case very simple code then switch the condition try to put shortest code part in forst condition
in vscode sourcery.ai extension

7. bignumbers can be separated using underscores: 100_00_000_00
8. enumerate -- returns index and element in lists
for index,name in enumerate(names) : 
  print(index,name)
for index,name in enumerate(names,start = 1): 
  print(index,name)

  start --  helps us to index our number form desired digit

u can use two lists at a time
capitals = ['A','B','C','D','E']
smalls = ['a','b','c','d','e']
for index,letter in enumerate(capitals):
  s = smalls[index]
  print(f'{s} is actually {letter}')
9. instead of 
a= 1
b = 
we can use 
(a,b) = (1,2)
10 for dictionaries:
  to iterate through the dictionaries:
  for key,value in freq.items():
  print(key,value)

Which file changes if input format changes?
marks_reader changes.
Which file changes if new analysis is added?
marks_analyzer
Which file should almost never change?
main
Is any file doing more than one job?
yes marks_analyzer is doing multiple tasks like finding average, highest,lowest,counting...

If data comes from API instead of file, what changes?
API is used so that it will be supported by all softwares, files will not be compatible for all softwares
If we add UI/web app, what stays the same?
backend working logic stays same
If dataset becomes 10× bigger, what might break?
scalability, system 

“Explain your project design like I’m a non-technical manager.”
on day5 i have created a project to analyze marks and give analysis, in main file we will create instance to read marks from the file and those marks will be given to marks_analyzer class and give analyzis of the marks
