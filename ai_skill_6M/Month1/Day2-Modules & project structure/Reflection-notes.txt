whenever we are importing a file it will import all its vriables,methods along with print statemnets
 if u want only that specific variable or method u can do so
If a python file has different methods we can import it 
1. using import file_name
and usage =>  temp = file_name.method_name()

other way
2. from file_name import method_name()
usage => temp = method_name()

3. we can import 
from file_name import *
This imports all names except those beginning with an underscore (_).

Also we can use Aliases
import file_name as file

also
from file_name import method_name as method

***** important
for efficiency resons every file is loaded only once when it is imported , so if u make any changes in the imported files , u must restart the interpreater to import the updated file,, but if u have only 1 file to reload u can use 
importlib.reload
i.e;
 import importlib
 importlib.reload(module_name)

 __name__ value depends on its usage
if that file is run directly then __name__ = "__main__"
if that file is imported into other file then value of __name__ = file_name

This is to control the executing of file

generally, when we import a file it will be auto executed (run) before we call it 
to control this we use this line __name__ = "__main__"
if we put thos line in parent file , it will not be auto executed , it will be executed only when it is called in the child file but not when it is imported




#6.4

from directory import *
doing this may import unnecessary files
local variables can shadow/overwrite importing files(modules) which will cause errors 
we can define __all__ = [] list of ubmodules needed to import when we use this line from directory import *
if __all__ is not defined does not import all submodules from package
