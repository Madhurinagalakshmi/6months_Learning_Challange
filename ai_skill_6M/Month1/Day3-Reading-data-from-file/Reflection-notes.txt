File-Objects
read only
f = open('filename.txt','r')
read and write --> r+
append(Adds text to the end of the filr automatically) -> 'a'
write ---> w (if that file does ot exist it wll create a new file , if exists it will overwrite the file)
f.name --> gives name of file
f.mode --> gives in what mode it is opened (eg.: r, r+....)
f.close() --> closes the file
with open('filename.txt','r') as f:    --> context manager : automatically closes file and clean up --> best practice
     pass  (we have to write everything here)
     for line in f:
         print(line,end=" ")
     f_cont = f.read()
              f.readlines()
              f.readline()  --> every time we run prints the next line
              f.read(100) readss 100 characters
              f.read(100) now this we take up next 10 chars and print them 
              f.seek(0) if we put it , it will not start from next char but will take up from 1st char  
f.closed --> tells if it os closed on not
withopen('filename.txt','w') as f:
   f.write('content u wnat to write')
   f.seek(0)  -> pointer goes to index 0
   f.write('g')
we can use two files at a time using nested statements

Try - Except:

try:
   file = open('filename.txt','r')
except Exception as e:
   print('error',e)
else: --> if try block does not raise an exception
  pass
finally:
  pass
