What change improved robustness the most?
i have updated variable names , which makes the code more readble.I have also updated the code to catch only expecting exceptions, so that it helps me to know different possible expections . 
Which bug would have been hardest to catch in production?
import error
What assumption did you remove today?

What still feels fragile?
