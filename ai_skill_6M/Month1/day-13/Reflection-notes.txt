Q.Which logic appears more than once?
 1. checking if the input is empty.
 2. looping through values
 3. finding sum

Which parts could be reused in another project?
  file importing and reading part
  logic of anlayzer
  connection between the files through main
Which parts are specific only to expenses?
  cateogory, input format

Generalize ONE Analyzer Pattern:
we can separate prices into separate array and work on it.

What part could be reused for any file-based reader?
parsing thhrough each line and collecting data
What part is expense-specific?
choosing the data structure would be expense specifc .

What duplication did you notice only now?
 1. checking if the input is empty.
 2. looping through values
 3. finding sum
What logic surprised you by being reusable?
looping through values
What did you decide not to abstract? Why?
“I did not abstract expense categories because they are domain-specific and abstraction would make the code harder to understand without real reuse benefit.
How would this help your next project?
i would use the structure for future projects but not the code and logic because they depend on the purpose of the project.
